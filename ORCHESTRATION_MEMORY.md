# ORCHESTRATION MEMORY — Canonical Control-Plane Context

## Purpose

This file is the durable, version-controlled memory of the AI orchestration control plane. Before modifying the orchestrator, treat this document and the current source tree as the source of truth. Do not assume older conversation state is still accurate without checking the repository.

## Current baseline

Repository: `orionrayy/ai-determinism-engine`
Primary branch: `main`
Latest verified main commit: `205dc1b72e442b5a63f7dbede9077395a362c3ab`
Execution model: GitHub Actions + stdlib Python
Cost policy: free-first; `ORCHESTRATOR_FREE_ONLY=true` in the production workflow

## Architecture

```
GOAL / EVENT
  -> planner (Gemini or deterministic fallback)
  -> validated DAG
  -> risk/policy enforcement
  -> one-node-per-run executor
  -> tool adapter
  -> validation
  -> retry / replan
  -> checkpoint + persisted state
  -> workflow_run continuation
  -> next node
```

State machine:

```
pending -> ready -> running -> validating -> completed
                       |             |
                       +-> retrying -+
                       |
                       +-> waiting_approval
                       |
                       +-> failed -> replanning -> ready
```

High-risk operations require explicit approval in live mode unless the workflow invocation explicitly supplies approval.

## Trigger model

Supported entry points:
- manual `workflow_dispatch`
- authenticated external ingress through `gateway.py` using `repository_dispatch`
- source GitHub Issues prefixed `[ORCHESTRATOR]`
- scheduled recovery every 15 minutes
- approval/rejection label events on `[ORCHESTRATOR APPROVAL]` issues
- post-run continuation through `workflow_run`

Continuation must target the exact persisted workflow. Never infer the target solely from `last_workflow_id`.

## Free-first policy

Registry is authoritative through `orchestrator/tools.json`.

Free-tier declarations currently include:
- github
- gemini
- wikipedia
- research_bundle
- noop

Non-free declarations currently include:
- openai
- firecrawl
- webhook

Live free-only execution must reject a non-free adapter. Dry-run may simulate any registered adapter without requiring credentials, while still preferring free adapters.

Do not add a new tool without an explicit `free_tier` declaration.

## Research layer

`orchestrator/research_bundle.py` provides credential-free:
- Wikipedia
- arXiv
- Crossref

It tolerates partial provider failure as long as at least one provider succeeds.

## GitHub adapter

Allowlisted operations:
- metadata
- read_file
- create_issue
- create_or_update_file
- delete_file
- dispatch_workflow

Write/delete/dispatch operations are high-risk and approval-gated in live mode.

Repository path traversal is rejected. File writes have a 512 KiB payload safety limit.

## Security model

- External HTTP is HTTPS-only.
- Gateway supports bearer or timestamped HMAC authentication with replay window.
- Source Issue triggers are restricted to OWNER/MEMBER/COLLABORATOR.
- Approval labels are additionally authorized against the label actor's repository permission.
- Do not put secrets or private data into GitHub Issues or committed state.
- The current repository is public; persisted state is therefore not a private datastore.
- Keep shell inputs quoted and do not execute goal text as shell code.

## Persistence

Workflow state is committed under `.orchestrator/`.
Each workflow stores:
- workflow id
- created/updated timestamps
- goal
- live/dry-run mode
- trigger issue
- originating GitHub Actions run id
- node state
- retry/replan counters
- outputs/errors/checkpoints

Multiple workflows are scheduled fairly by oldest `updated_at`.

## Recovery semantics

A failed node:
1. retries with bounded exponential backoff;
2. returns to `running` before a second execution attempt;
3. may use a registry fallback tool;
4. may replan up to the global limit;
5. otherwise fails the workflow.

Continuation dispatch occurs only after the worker's state persistence, preventing the former pre-persistence race.

## CI gate

`.github/workflows/orchestrator-tests.yml` performs:
- Python compilation
- all orchestrator unit tests
- gateway tests
- workflow configuration invariants

Never merge a control-plane change with a red CI result.

## Important historical defects already fixed

- stale in-worker continuation dispatcher
- approval labels not triggering worker
- approval creating a new workflow instead of resuming exact workflow
- continuation selecting wrong workflow through `last_workflow_id`
- pending workflow starvation
- planner risk understatement
- hard-coded paid-tool blacklist bypass
- dry-run blocked by missing credentials
- retry path `ready -> retrying` illegal transition
- approval actor authorization gap
- missing controlled GitHub artifact operations
- incorrect 404 handling for GitHub file creation

## Known remaining architectural limits

1. GitHub Actions does not directly invoke the ChatGPT-installed connector catalog. External connector bridges still require their own API or gateway boundary. `orchestrator/connector_bridge.py` now defines that vendor-neutral boundary as protocol v1.
2. `.orchestrator/` is repository-backed persistence. Public-repository state is not suitable for secrets or private workflow payloads.
3. Side-effect recovery is fail-closed, not automatically reconciled. An `execution_uncertain` workflow needs external-state inspection before it can safely be resumed.
4. Connector bridge v1 is vendor-neutral; a real Notion/Figma/Canva/ClickUp/etc. bridge service must implement the protocol and its own vendor OAuth/API policy.
5. The current validation stage is structurally present but provider-specific semantic validation remains minimal.
6. There is no dedicated distributed database or event bus; GitHub Actions + committed state is intentionally the zero-new-service implementation.

## Deployment targets

The connector bridge runtime can be hosted as a Vercel Python Function (`api/bridge.py`) or as a Render Web Service (`bridge_server.py`). Both expose the same protocol runtime and require `ORCHESTRATOR_CONNECTOR_BRIDGE_SECRET` plus `ORCHESTRATOR_CONNECTOR_ROUTES`. Deployment is not considered verified until the public `/health` endpoint responds successfully.

## Protocol for future changes

Before changing runtime behavior:
1. Read this file.
2. Inspect current `main`.
3. Identify the exact invariant being changed.
5. Add a regression test before or with the change.
6. Run CI.
7. Merge only after green.
8. Update this memory file when architecture, policy, or a known limitation changes.

## Design principle

The system should fail closed on unsafe tool selection, fail open on optional observability, remain deterministic under duplicate events, and preserve explicit human approval for irreversible external effects.
